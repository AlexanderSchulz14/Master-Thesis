\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

A possible extension of this thesis would be to actually use the estimated slope factor in a probabilistic setting like the one proposed by \citet{estrella1991term} and see if said factor, being an approximation of the term spread, is able to correctly predict the onset of past recessions.  Furthermore, testing the performance in yield curve movement forecasting of a general Nelson-Siegel decomposition approach as well as an extended model including macro variables in a machine learning setting vis-a-vis various other benchmark models could be further enlightening.
