In our no-arbitrage model, the short rate follows a version of the Taylor's (1993 , "Discretion Versus Policy Rules in Practice", Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy, 39, 195--214) rule where the coefficients on the output gap and inflation vary over time. The monetary policy loading on the output gap has averaged around 0·4 and has not changed very much over time. The overall response of the yield curve to output gap components is relatively small. In contrast, the inflation loading has changed substantially over the last 50 years and ranges from close to zero in 2003 to a high of 2·4 in 1983. Long-term bonds are sensitive to inflation policy shifts with increases in inflation loadings leading to higher short rates and widening yield spreads. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.},

In contrast, shadow-rate DTSMs account for the ZLB by construction, capture the resulting distributional asymmetry of future short rates, and achieve good forecast performance. These models provide more accurate estimates of the most likely path for future monetary policy—including the timing of policy liftoff from the ZLB and the pace of subsequent policy tightening. We also demonstrate the benefits of including macroeconomic factors in a shadow-rate DTSM when yields are constrained near the ZLB.},

abstract = {Summary US yield curve dynamics are subject to time-variation, but there is ambiguity about its precise form. This paper develops a vector autoregressive (VAR) model with time-varying parameters and stochastic volatility, which treats the nature of parameter dynamics as unknown. Coefficients can evolve according to a random walk, a Markov switching process, observed predictors, or depend on a mixture of these. To decide which form is supported by the data and to carry out model selection, we adopt Bayesian shrinkage priors. Our framework is applied to model the US yield curve. We show that the model forecasts well, and focus on selected in-sample features to analyze determinants of structural breaks in US yield curve dynamics.},

abstract = {This paper reviews alternative options for monetary policy when the short-term interest rate is at the zero lower bound and develops new empirical estimates of the effects of the maturity structure of publicly held debt on the term structure of interest rates. We use a model of risk-averse arbitrageurs to develop measures of how the maturity structure of debt held by the public might affect the pricing of level, slope, and curvature term structure risk. We find that these Treasury factors historically were quite helpful for predicting both yields and excess returns over 1990–2007. The historical correlations are consistent with the claim that if in December 2006, the Fed were to have sold off all its Treasury holdings of less than 1-year maturity (about \$400 billion) and use the proceeds to retire Treasury debt from the long end, this might have resulted in a 14-basis-point drop in the 10-year rate and an 11-basis-point increase in the 6-month rate. We also develop a description of how the dynamic behavior of the term structure of interest rates changed after hitting the zero lower bound in 2009. Our estimates imply that at the zero lower bound, such a maturity swap would have the same effects as buying \$400 billion in long-term maturities outright with newly created reserves and could reduce the 10-year rate by 13 basis points without raising short-term yields.},

I propose correcting that deficiency by adjusting the entire GATSM term structure with an explicit function of maturity that represents the optionality associated with the present and future availability of physical currency. The resulting ZLB-GATSM framework remains tractable, producing a simple closed-form analytic expression for forward rates and requiring only elementary univariate numerical integration (over time to maturity) to obtain interest rates and bond prices. I demonstrate the salient features of the ZLB- GATSM framework using a two-factor model. An illustrative estimation with U.S. term structure data indicates that the ZLB-GATSM \&quot;shadow short rate\&quot; provides a useful gauge of the stance of monetary policy; in particular becoming negative when the U.S. policy rate reached the ZLB in late 2008, and moving more negative with subsequent unconventional monetary policy easings.},

Our identifying assumption is that unexpected changes in interest rates in a 30-minute window surrounding scheduled Federal Reserve announcements arise from news about monetary policy. In response to an interest rate hike, nominal and real interest rates increase roughly one-for-one, several years out into the term structure, while the response of expected inflation is small. At the same time, forecasts about output growth also increase—the opposite of what standard models imply about a monetary tightening. To explain these facts, we build a model in which Fed announcements affect beliefs not only about monetary policy but also about other economic fundamentals. Our model implies that these information effects play an important role in the overall causal effect of monetary policy shocks on output.}",

abstract = {The use of changes in short-term interest rates (STIRs) within 30 min before and after monetary policy announcements, or so-called high-frequency identification (HFI), has been attracting attention as a method of extracting monetary policy surprises. In this paper, we use the Japanese data during the 2000s and 2010s, which includes periods when interest rates hovered around the ELB, to construct an indicator of monetary policy surprises using HFI and document its properties. We find that the STIR futures variations within 30 min around monetary policy announcements are more closely correlated with key financial variables than those outside that window. We also find that the impulse responses of macroeconomic variables to the identified shocks are overall in line with what conventional theory predicts.}

abstract = {This article uses a structural VAR with daily data to identify the effects of monetary policy shocks on various longer term interest rates since the federal funds rate has been stuck at the zero lower bound. The VAR is identified using the assumption that monetary policy shocks are heteroskedastic: monetary policy shocks have especially high variance on days of FOMC meetings and certain speeches, while there is otherwise nothing unusual about these days. A complementary high-frequency event-study approach is also used. I find that stimulative monetary policy shocks lower Treasury and corporate bond yields but the effects die off fairly fast.},

We show that such a model offers an excellent description of the data compared to the benchmark model and can be used to summarize the macroeconomic effects of unconventional monetary policy. Our estimates imply that the efforts by the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy since July 2009 succeeded in making the unemployment rate in December 2013 1\% lower, which is 0.13\% more compared to the historical behavior of the Fed.},

We show that the contribution of the spread can be decomposed into the effect of expected future changes in short rates and the effect of the term premium. We find that both factors are relevant for predicting real GDP growth but the respective contributions differ. We investigate whether the cyclical behavior of interest rate volatility could account for either or both effects. We find that while volatility displays important correlations with both the term structure of interest rates and GDP, it does not appear to account for the yield spread's usefulness for predicting GDP growth.},
